To ensure that you can fully participate during the workshop, please make sure you have the most recent versions of R and R Studio installed on your computer. Even if you have installed R in the past, it will be important for you to make sure you have the latest version. We have prepared this workshop with R version 4.0.3. 

#### To R download R:  
1. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/  
2. Click "Download R for Mac/Windows"  
3. Download the appropriate file:  
   - Windows users click Base, and download the installer for the latest R version  
   - Mac users select the file R-3.X.X that aligns with your OS version  
4. Follow the instructions of the installer   

#### To download RStudio:  
1. Go to RStudio for desktop https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download  
2. Select the install file for your OS  
3. Follow the instructions of the installer  

Also, it would be useful to download the following R packages prior to the workshop:  

*	here
*	tidyverse
* ggplot2
* ggraph
* igraph
* ggsn
*	patchwork
* ggsci
* sf


For new R useRs: open R studio and type the following code into the console, OR you can go over the "Packages" tab in the bottom right hand corner of RStudio, click "install", and type in the names of the packages that you would like to install. Once you have installed a package on your computer, there is no need to install again. Instead, each time you need to use the package you use the `library()` code (as shown below).

```r
install.packages(c("here", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "ggraph", "igraph", "ggsn", "patchwork", "ggsci", "library", "sf"))
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
library(ggsn)
library(patchwork)
library(ggsci)
library(sf)
```
